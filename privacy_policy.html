    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Last updated: 21-Jan-2025</p>
    
        <p>Thank you for using SolveIt Homework Help (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
        <p>If you have any questions or require any additional details, please let us know, and we will update this policy accordingly.</p>
    
        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> When you use Google Sign-In, we may receive basic profile information such as your name and email address. This data is used solely for authentication purposes—to create or verify your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera Access & Images:</strong> The App allows you to take photos or upload existing images for homework-related purposes. These images are processed and sent to an AI service (see Section 2) to generate solutions. The App does not permanently store these images on our servers; however, temporary copies or cached versions may exist locally on your device or in memory during processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Uploaded Files & Text:</strong> You can upload various types of documents (e.g., PDF, Word files) and/or enter text questions. This content (“User Content”) is also processed by the AI service to generate answer responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information & Log Data:</strong> We may collect information such as your device model, operating system, unique device identifiers, and usage statistics through third-party tools (including Firebase Analytics and Google AdMob). These tools help us monitor and improve the App’s performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Token:</strong> We use FCM to send push notifications. A unique FCM token is collected to deliver notifications to your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> When you purchase a subscription, we collect information about your subscription status, including the type of subscription, purchase date, renewal date, and payment status. This information is processed through Google Play Billing and is used to manage your subscription and provide access to premium features.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> Text, images, and other uploaded content are sent to a generative AI service for analysis and solution generation. We do not use these contents for any purpose other than providing you with homework help.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Your Google account information is used to sign you in and keep track of your usage limits or unlock premium features, if any.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad Serving:</strong> We use Google AdMob to serve ads within the App. AdMob may collect device information and usage data to provide personalized or contextual ads, in accordance with Google’s own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Firebase Analytics and other analytics tools help us understand how users interact with the App (e.g., which features are most popular). These insights allow us to improve the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> We use your subscription data to manage your access to premium features, such as ad-free usage and unlimited question submissions. This includes verifying your subscription status and notifying you of upcoming renewals or changes to your subscription.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>DATA STORAGE & SECURITY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> When signed in, the App may store your conversation history locally on your device (“history_<uid>.json”), including your questions and AI-generated solutions. You control access to these files.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Services:</strong> Basic authentication data and FCM tokens are stored on Firebase servers. AI queries (text and images) are transmitted to and processed by Google’s Generative AI services.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We share your information with third-party service providers only when necessary to deliver the App’s core features (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Firebase Remote Config, Google AI services, AdMob).</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> We share subscription-related information with Google Play Billing to process payments, manage subscriptions, and handle refunds or cancellations.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>ADVERTISING</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AdMob:</strong> We integrate advertisements using Google AdMob, which may collect personal and non-personal device information for ad targeting. Review Google’s and AdMob’s privacy policies for further details on how they handle your data.</li>
            <li>We use the Advertising ID to serve personalized ads and measure ad performance. You can reset your Advertising ID in your device settings at any time.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>The App is not specifically targeted toward children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>
    
        <h2>RETENTION & DELETION</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We retain personal data for as long as needed to provide services to you or as long as you have an account with us.</li>
            <li>You can delete locally stored questions/answers from your device at any time. If you would like your account data (including your Firebase Authentication details) to be removed, please contact us.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> We retain subscription-related data for as long as your subscription is active and for a reasonable period afterward to comply with legal obligations and resolve disputes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
        <p>The services we use (Firebase, Google AI) may process and store data on servers located in various countries. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your information to servers that may be outside of your country.</p>
    
        <h2>YOUR RIGHTS & CHOICES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> You may access or update your account details by managing your Google Account settings or contacting us directly.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Ads:</strong> You can adjust your device’s ad tracking preferences via your device Settings to limit personalized ads.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can disable FCM notifications in the App settings or device settings at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription through your <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">Google Play account subscriptions</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy in the App or through other appropriate methods.</p>
