        <p>Last Updated: 21-Jan-2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to SolveIt Homework Help (“the App”), an Android application designed to assist users with homework questions through AI-generated solutions. These Terms of Service (“ToS”) form a legal agreement between you (“User”) and SolveIt (“we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your use of the App. By accessing or using SolveIt Homework Help, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these ToS. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>SCOPE OF SERVICE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homework Assistance.</strong> The App provides Google Gemini's AI-based solution engine which generates step-by-step methods to solve or explain homework problems. While we strive to ensure high-quality answers, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or correctness of AI-generated solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content.</strong> The App allows you to submit text and upload or capture images and files (PDF, DOC, images, etc.) for analysis. These items are processed to produce AI-generated answers. You remain solely responsible for the content you provide, including any legal or privacy obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Management.</strong> Google Sign-In is used for authentication. By signing in, you agree to comply with Google’s Terms of Service and any other requirements specified by Google.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Requirement.</strong> The App is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 18, you should only use the App under the supervision of a parent or guardian who agrees to these ToS.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance.</strong> You agree to comply with local laws and regulations regarding the import/export of software, personal data, and AI-generated content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurate Information.</strong> You must provide correct and up-to-date account information during sign-up or login, including valid credentials through Google Sign-In.</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptable Use.</strong> You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone’s use or enjoyment of the App. You must not:
                <ul>
                    <li>Post or transmit malicious code, viruses, or harmful content.</li>
                    <li>Use the App to harass, threaten, or transmit any form of hate speech.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to breach or misuse the App’s security or network.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integrity of Submissions.</strong> You must not use the App to facilitate academic dishonesty. The App is meant to help you learn and understand concepts; it is not intended to complete tests, exams, or graded assignments on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Management.</strong> You are responsible for managing your subscription, including canceling or modifying it through your <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">Google Play account subscriptions</a>. Failure to cancel a subscription before the renewal date will result in charges for the next billing cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Unauthorized Use.</strong> You must not share your subscription benefits with others or use the App in a way that violates the terms of your subscription.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI-GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of AI Responses.</strong> The App uses generative AI to provide homework explanations. AI-generated responses may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inapplicable to your specific situation. You acknowledge that any reliance on such responses is at your own risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Purposes Only.</strong> Content generated by the App should be treated as informational or educational guidance, not a definitive or professional source. Always verify solutions with credible sources, especially for academic submissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>USER CONTENT & FILE STORAGE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Uploads and Images.</strong> You can upload images or documents (e.g., PDF, DOC, XLS) for processing. The App may temporarily store, cache, or transmit these files to third-party AI services for generating solutions. We do not permanently store these files on our servers, although partial or cached data may exist for the sole purpose of generating AI responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Local History.</strong> The App may save your question-and-answer history locally on your device. You can delete this history at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Ownership.</strong> You retain ownership of User-Generated Content you upload. We only use your submissions to provide the requested AI-based solutions within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>SUBSCRIPTIONS & PAYMENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Subscription Plans.</strong> The App offers subscription plans (e.g., SolveIt Lite, SolveIt Plus, SolveIt Pro) that provide additional features, such as ad-free usage and unlimited question submissions. Subscription plans may vary in duration (e.g., weekly, monthly, yearly) and pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing.</strong> All payments for subscriptions are processed through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to Google Play’s Terms of Service and acknowledge that your payment will be charged to your Google Play account.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Renewal.</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless you cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the renewal date. You can manage or cancel your subscription through your <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">Google Play account subscriptions</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> Refunds are subject to Google Play’s refund policy. We do not provide refunds for subscription fees unless required by law. If you believe you are entitled to a refund, please contact <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/" target="_blank">Google Play Support</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad-Free Experience.</strong> Subscribing to a premium plan removes all advertisements from the App. Non-subscribers will still see ads, including rewarded ads, as part of the free tier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services.</strong> The App uses services from Google (e.g., Firebase, Google Sign-In, Google AI). By using these features, you also agree to Google’s terms and policies, including Google’s Privacy Policy and any applicable Developer Policies.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Generative Services.</strong> The App integrates with third-party AI APIs (e.g., Google’s Generative AI Library) to process your questions, images, and documents. We do not control or guarantee the functionality, availability, or results of these third-party services.</li>
            <li><strong>External Links.</strong> The App may contain links to external websites or resources. We are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these external sites, nor for the content, products, or services on or available from such sites.</li>
