        <p>Last Updated: 25-Dec-2024</p>

        <p>Welcome to SolveIt Homework Help (“the App”), an Android application designed to assist users with homework questions through AI-generated solutions. These Terms of Service (“ToS”) form a legal agreement between you (“User”) and SolveIt (“we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your use of the App. By accessing or using SolveIt Homework Help, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these ToS. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>SCOPE OF SERVICE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homework Assistance.</strong> The App provides an AI-based solution engine which generates step-by-step methods to solve or explain homework problems. While we strive to ensure high-quality answers, we do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or correctness of AI-generated solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Generated Content.</strong> The App allows you to upload or capture images and files (PDF, DOC, images, etc.) for analysis. These items are processed to produce AI-generated answers. You remain solely responsible for the content you provide, including any legal or privacy obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Management.</strong> Google Sign-In is used for authentication. By signing in, you agree to comply with Google’s Terms of Service and any other requirements specified by Google.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Requirement.</strong> The App is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. If you are under 18, you should only use the App under the supervision of a parent or guardian who agrees to these ToS.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance.</strong> You agree to comply with local laws and regulations regarding the import/export of software, personal data, and AI-generated content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurate Information.</strong> You must provide correct and up-to-date account information during sign-up or login, including valid credentials through Google Sign-In.</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptable Use.</strong> You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone’s use or enjoyment of the App. You must not:
                <ul>
                    <li>Post or transmit malicious code, viruses, or harmful content.</li>
                    <li>Use the App to harass, threaten, or transmit any form of hate speech.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to breach or misuse the App’s security or network.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Integrity of Submissions.</strong> You must not use the App to facilitate academic dishonesty. The App is meant to help you learn and understand concepts; it is not intended to complete tests, exams, or graded assignments on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI-GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nature of AI Responses.</strong> The App uses generative AI to provide homework explanations. AI-generated responses may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inapplicable to your specific situation. You acknowledge that any reliance on such responses is at your own risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Purposes Only.</strong> Content generated by the App should be treated as informational or educational guidance, not a definitive or professional source. Always verify solutions with credible sources, especially for academic submissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>USER CONTENT & FILE STORAGE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>File Uploads and Images.</strong> You can upload images or documents (e.g., PDF, DOC, XLS) for processing. The App may temporarily store, cache, or transmit these files to third-party AI services for generating solutions. We do not permanently store these files on our servers, although partial or cached data may exist for the sole purpose of generating AI responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Local History.</strong> The App may save your question-and-answer history locally on your device. You can delete this history at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Ownership.</strong> You retain ownership of User-Generated Content you upload. We only use your submissions to provide the requested AI-based solutions within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>PAYMENTS & ADVERTISEMENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Tier and Daily Question Limit.</strong> The App includes a free tier with a daily question limit. This limit may reset every 24 hours. Once the limit is reached, you may not submit further questions unless you watch a video advertisement or subscribe to a premium plan (if available).</li>
            <li><strong>Rewarded Ads.</strong> By watching a rewarded ad, you may temporarily extend your daily question limit. You agree and consent to viewing these ads in exchange for additional usage.</li>
            <li><strong>External Ad Services.</strong> The App implements third-party advertising platforms (e.g., Google AdMob). These third parties may track certain non-personal or personal data in compliance with their privacy policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services.</strong> The App uses services from Google (e.g., Firebase, Google Sign-In, Google AI). By using these features, you also agree to Google’s terms and policies, including Google’s Privacy Policy and any applicable Developer Policies.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Generative Services.</strong> The App integrates with third-party AI APIs (e.g., Google’s Generative AI Library) to process your questions, images, and documents. We do not control or guarantee the functionality, availability, or results of these third-party services.</li>
            <li><strong>External Links.</strong> The App may contain links to external websites or resources. We are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these external sites, nor for the content, products, or services on or available from such sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>APP UPDATES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play In-App Updates.</strong> The App uses Google Play’s in-app update features to ensure that you receive the latest version and security patches. You agree to install updates promptly.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Availability.</strong> We make no guarantee that updates will always be available or resolve every issue. Delayed or ignored updates may compromise the App’s functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ownership.</strong> We own or license all intellectual property rights in the App, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, and software code.</li>
            <li><strong>License.</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these ToS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>“As Is” Basis.</strong> The App and AI-generated content are provided “as is” with no warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect Damages.</strong> We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits or data, arising from your use or inability to use the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Use at Your Own Risk.</strong> Homework solutions or instructions provided may be incorrect or incomplete. You assume full responsibility for any reliance on such information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grounds for Termination.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, for any reason, with or without notice, including if you breach these ToS.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. We may delete your stored data after a grace period, unless otherwise required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>

            <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These ToS are governed by the laws of [Your Country/State], without regard to conflict-of-law principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong> Any disputes arising from or related to these ToS shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in [Your City/Region], unless another forum is mandated by applicable law.</li>
